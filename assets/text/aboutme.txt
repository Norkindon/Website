I really wanted to get an AI to generate an about me section because it feels painfully cringe to write, but then I found that doing that also rendered equally cringe results with the added negative of being artificially generated content. 

Welcome viewer, this is my, Nick Bixler's website. 

I am a multimedia artist based in the flourishing metropolis of Tbilisi, Georgia. 

For the past 15+ I have crafted this-or-that's . For over 10 of those years I have freelanced in a variety of fields, never tying myself down to one method. All sorts of media has been dabbled in to various degrees, but today I find myself mostly focusing on audio production and digital art. I am currently engaging in website and Ui/UX design. 

This website, while being a portfolio, is also a statement piece of sorts for my capacity to do the afformentioned.
