Nice to meet you I'm Nick, a multi-disciplinary designer from and based Tbilisi, Georgia. I can't really show much of what Iâ€™m working on, but it has to do with audio engineering, software and website design. The site you see here is more meant to be a playground for the stuff I do besides my work. Enjoy, have fun and feel free to reach out.
